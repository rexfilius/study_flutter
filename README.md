# study_flutter

This project is like a library where I note every thing I learn as regards Flutter development.

A branch will be created for every note.

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
